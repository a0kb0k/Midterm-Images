    "When doing FEA analyses, the geometry of each part plays a major part in meshing. In general, slender geometries (long and thin) result in high number of elements when creating the mesh, which can lead to singularities that don't give realistic results, or lead to long computation times because of all the elements that need calculating. PCB boards already have a slender shape to them since they are typically wider and longer than they are thick - and it gets even worse with the fact that PCBs are laminated layers of different materials. The best way to treat PCB boards is to treat all the layers as one single material (instead of multiple thin layers) in order to save a mesh from going overboard. However to do this, overall thermal properties of the board will need to be re-calculated to ensure realistic results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the overall conductance of the board, the geometry and thermal properties of each layer must be defined. The class method, PCB_Layer(), takes in the geometry of the layer (length (m), width (m), and thickness(m)) and the isotropic thermal conductivity values (k (W/mK) in the x-, y-, and z-direction) to build the thermal resistance network. \n",
    "**Units for the input\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an additional input where you can specify how many layers of the material there are in the board. PCBs commonly have multiple layers of the same material (typically Copper and some insulative material) in alternating pattern. However, to calculate the overall thermal conductivity of the board, the exact positon of each layer does not need to be defined - but rather how many layers there are of it. \n",
    "**PCB stack-up\n",
    "\n",
    "From there, the thermal resitance of the layer can be calculated. For the thermal resistance in the normal direction (ie going through the board), this is calculated in series - much like how the heat is going through layer after layer. The thermal resistance in the transverse direction (ie along the width and length of the board), this is calculated in parallel since the heat is going through all of the laminate layers at once. \n",

The next two inputs - width and height - are simply the width and heights of the pad, and taken from the component's datasheet. The 'ori' input serves as the orientation of the component with a value of \"1\" being vertical (where the longest length of the pad is along the global y-dir) and a value of \"0\" being horizontal (where the longest length of the pad is in the global x-dir).A similar approach is done for the PCB_Comp_cir() class method.\n",
